# REGP-CPU Emulator
A fantasy computer emulator, to study how to implement CPU emulators in javascript.
Besides the emulator, this project contains a assembler and a disassembler, allowing anyone to create their own programs.

## How to assemble code and run it on the emulator
``` shell
npm install
npm start "./asm-examples/fibonacci.asm"
```

## How to run the disassembler
``` shell
npm run dsm "./asm-compiled-examples/fibonacci"
```
